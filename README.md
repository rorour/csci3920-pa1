### To Do List:
- [X] Create packages 
- [X] Create classes
- [ ] Add constructors, getters/setters to classes
  - [ ] User + child classes
  - [X] Order
  - [ ] Product + child classes
  - [ ] Catalog
- [X] Methods, but not implemented
  - [X] Company
  - [X] Server/Client classes

### Notes:
- By the weekened the goal is to have have all classes/packages created, with constructors, getters/setters and some methods. 
Methods don't need to be implemented yet. (is this a reasonable goal?).

## List of what we're doing
#### Raven:
#### Lora: Server, Client and ClientWorker methods are written in. I'm working on Company now (just writing the methods w/out implementing them)

(just setting it up for now. Basically we write down what we're working on here to prevent overriding our work when we're working separtely. Luckily it doesn't matter if we do accidently work on the same thing because of github branching feature).

Team 2 Java PA1

### To Do List:
- [X] Create packages 
- [X] Create classes
- [ ] Add constructors, getters/setters to classes
  - [ ] User + child classes
  - [ ] Order
  - [X] Product + child classes
  - [ ] Catalog
- [ ] Methods, but not implemented
  - [ ] Company
  - [X] Server/Client classes

### Notes:
- By the weekened the goal is to have have all classes/packages created, with constructors, getters/setters and some methods. 
Methods don't need to be implemented yet. (is this a reasonable goal?).

## List of what we're doing
#### Raven: Product & subclasses, Category, & related methods in Company
#### Lora: Server, Client and ClientWorker methods are written in. I'm working on Company now (just writing the methods w/out implementing them)
